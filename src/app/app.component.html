                    Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has several plot lines and a
                    large ensemble cast but centers on three primary story arcs. The first story arc centers on the Iron
                    Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and follows a web of alliances and conflicts among the dynastic noble
                    families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from the throne. The second
                    story arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, exiled and plotting
                    a return to the throne. The third story arc centers on the longstanding brotherhood charged with
                    defending the realm against the ancient threats of the fierce peoples and legendary creatures that
                    lie far north, and an impending winter that threatens the realm.

            <owl-tab label="The Walking Dead">
                <div class="owlng-tabs-demo-content" [style.padding.px]="20">
                    The Walking Dead takes place after the onset of a worldwide zombie apocalypse. The zombies,
                    colloquially referred to as "walkers", shamble towards living humans and other creatures to eat them
                    (they are attracted to noise, e.g., gunshots, and to different scents, e.g., humans). Humans that
                    they bite or scratch become infected and slowly turn into walkers as well. It is revealed early in
                    the series that all living humans carry this pathogen, so that if they die from any other cause,
                    they will also turn into walkers. The only way to permanently kill a walker is to damage its brain
                    or otherwise fully destroy the body, such as by cremating it.

            <owl-tab label="Modern Family">
                <div class="owlng-tabs-demo-content" [style.padding.px]="20">
                    Modern Family revolves around three different types of families (nuclear, step- and same-sex) living
                    in the Los Angeles area who are interrelated through Jay Pritchett and his children, Claire Dunphy
                    (née Pritchett) and Mitchell Pritchett. Patriarch Jay is remarried to a much younger woman, Gloria
                    Delgado Pritchett (née Ramirez), a passionate[5] Colombian with whom he has an infant son, Fulgencio
                    (Joe) Pritchett, and a son from Gloria's previous marriage,[6] Manny Delgado. Jay's daughter Claire
                    was a homemaker, but has returned to the business world. She now works in her father's closet
                    business. She is married to Phil Dunphy, a realtor and self-professed "cool Dad". They have three
                    children: Haley Dunphy, a stereotypical ditzy teenage girl;[7] Alex Dunphy, a nerdy, smart middle
                    child;[8] and Luke Dunphy, the off-beat only son.[9] Jay's lawyer son Mitchell and his husband
                    Cameron Tucker have an adopted Vietnamese daughter, Lily Tucker-Pritchett. As the name suggests,
                    this family represents a modern-day family and episodes are comically based on situations which many
                    families encounter in real life.
